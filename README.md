# LICS
Linux IOT Control Service

LISC is my first project on GitHub!

**What is my Idea with LISC?**

I will make a simple user friendly interface for internet of the things where you can add easily things to the system without many programm ing.
The things are atmel microchips that are used in arduinos that are connected to a raspberry via the bus **IÂ²C** or the **NRFL ( * *2.4 GHz* *  ) wireless modules** .

This Project is at the beginning!

Im looking forward for every idea!
