# LICS
Linux IOT Control Service


My first project on GitHub!
LICS is also my first public Project!

What is my Idea?
I will make a simple user friendly interface for iots(internet of the things).
The things are arduinos that are connected to a raspberry via iÂ² or nrfl modules.

This Project is at the beginning!
Im looking forward for every idea!
